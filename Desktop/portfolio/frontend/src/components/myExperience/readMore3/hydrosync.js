                        <p className="small-text200">‚≠êÔ∏è HydroSync is a non-invasive hydration monitoring solution that utilizes electrodermal activity  &#40;EDA&#41; patches seamlessly integrated into the sole of shoes to assess hydration levels. The data is transmitted to our app, providing alerts and continuous monitoring functionalities. We aim to combat dehydration among the elderly, as it is often overlooked yet significantly impacts health.</p>
                        <p className="small-text200">‚ùì How Does it Work? Our mobile app uses the obtained data and employs a basic CNN model to analyze EDA signals, establishing individual hydration thresholds based on EDA changes and personal data. It then indicates hydration levels and alerts family members in case of alarming dehydration.</p>
